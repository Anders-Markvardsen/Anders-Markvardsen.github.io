<h2>Purpose of program </h2>
<p>Its purpose it to help determine the extinction symbol of a crystalline material from powder diffraction data; ExtSym does not distinguish between space groups which have the same extinction symbol.</p>
<p>It returns a ranked list of the probabilities of the extinction symbols belonging to a crystal system (which may e.g. be the orthorhombic or cubic crystal system). Of the 55 dataset tested in Ref [4] ExtSym ranks the published extinction symbol as the most probable symbol in 52 cases. Hence, the top ranked symbols from a ExtSym output table is very likely to include the correct extinction symbol which your crystalline powder belongs to. </p>
<p>Notice, this program does not index the unit cell. Therefore, before using ExtSym it is assumed the pattern has been successfully indexed by a program such as <a href="http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/solution/indexing/index.html">Dicvol, Ito or Treor</a>.</p>
<p>To browse  a collection of ExtSym test results click <a href="results.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>WARNING</h2>
<p>ExtSym was specifically made for the purpose of testing the algorithm presented in Ref. [1] and not much effort  was put in to make it user friendly. Therefore, if you adventure into trying it out, be prepared to be patient and perhaps  write a bit of code yourself!</p>
<h2>Required ExtSym input</h2>
<p>Extsym requires the input data to be in the form of Lorentz-polarisation corrected, extracted intensities (for more information see <a href="with-unknown-decom-prog.html">here</a>). Which means that before you use ExtSym you must perform a Pawley or le Bail refinement in a space group that has no systematic absences (for instance, P222 for an orthorhombic indexed crystal, p2 for a monoclinic indexed crystal and so on). </p>
<p>There exist no common format for the output formats returned by Pawley and le Bail programs, and these tend to be different from the input format required by ExtSym (described <a href="with-unknown-decom-prog.html">here</a>). Hence, scripts have been written for making it easier to use ExtSym with various programs. See the Download section below. </p>
<p>The ExtSym program is shipped with the commercial software <a href="http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/">DASH</a>, which includes a graphical user interface from which ExtSym can be executed. Before trying this out it is recommended to read <a href="addition-warnings.html">this  page</a> first. 
As of 11th March 2016 ExtSym is also shipped with <a href="http://www.panalytical.com/Xray-diffraction-software/HighScore.htm">HighScore</a> from PANalytical (incorporated in the "Plus" option). </p>
<p>Another strategy is to forget about using the ExtSym program as described on these pages and  write your own version of the space-group algorithm in Ref. [1]. <a href="http://www.accelrys.com/">Accelrys</a> has done this and their implementation is part of the commercial Reflex software. </p>
<h2><a name="copyright"></a>Copyright</h2>
<p> Copies of any binary version of ExtSym can be used for any purpose. The code makes heavy use of the Numerical Recipies library [2] (and also makes a couple of calls to functions from [3]). The source code minus the Numerical recipies libraries is now downloadable from <a href="https://github.com/Anders-Markvardsen/ExtSym">here</a>. The main reference for ExtSym is Ref. [4].</p>
<h2><a name="download"></a>Downloads </h2>
<p>ExtSym can be downloaded in 'raw format' or bundled together with various support scripts that make it easier to use ExtSym with a number of existing powder decomposition programs; note these scripts come with zero warranty. The source code for these are provided and these may be used as a starting point for written improved scripts.</p>

<h2>Changes to the code </h2>
<P>Since the submission of the paper [1] June 2000 the following changes have been made:</P>
<ul>
  <li>2/4-2001: Added code to allow ExtSym to accept .hkl data files containing any multiplet.</li>
<li>14/2-2002: Added code to allow for .hkl filenames that contain spaces.</li>
<li>15/10-2006: Added code that allow an additional powder data file format, that is the .hkl_weight format that is described <a href="with-unknown-decom-prog.html">here</a>. Updated the text printed to the screen to say &quot;ExtSym version 2006&quot;.</li>
<li>30/7-2007: Simplified the <a href="explain-output.html">table.asc output </a>to just containing the ranked table. </li>
<li>29/7-2008: Added option to allow combined search for trigonal and hexagonal extinction symbol (as noted would be useful by referee to paper [4]). </li>
<li>7/8-2008: Replaced 'Laue class' with 'crystal system' in parameter input file.</li>
<li>9/8-2008: Spotted and corrected for subtle error in way the systematic absences were handled for some of the hexagonal/trigonal extinction symbols. </li>
<li>8/4-2015: Removed repeated orthorhombic extinction symbol label 'P c c n' in table output (one of which should have read 'P c n n') as reported by Thomas Dortmann. </li>
</ul>
<P>For the most recent version of the source code now see <a href="https://github.com/Anders-Markvardsen/ExtSym">here</a></P>
<h2>Errata to  Ref. [1]</h2>
<p>Errata to Acta Cryst. A57, 47 (2001):</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the author list: J. C. Johnson should have been J. C. Johnston (many apologizes for this mistake). </li>
  <li>There is a misprint in Eq. (7). This equation should read C<span class="subscript">ij</span> / (C<span class="subscript">ii</span>*C<span class="subscript">jj</span>)<span class="superscript">1/2</span> not C<span class="subscript">ij</span> / (C<span class="subscript">ii</span>*C<span class="subscript">jj</span>)<span class="superscript">-1/2</span>.</li>
  <li>Replace all occurancies of 'Laue class' with 'crystal system'. </li>
</ul>
