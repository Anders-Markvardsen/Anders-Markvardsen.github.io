<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> ExtSym is designed to help crystallographers determining the extinction symbol of a crystalline powder sample from powder diffraction data. Before using ExtSym it is assumed that the crystallographer has successfully indexed the unit cell and therefore knows the crystal system that the crystalline powder belongs to.</p>
<p>ExtSym outputs a ranked list of the extinction symbols belonging to a crystal system; measured in terms of the logarithm of the probability of the extinction symbol in question (E<span class="subscript">gr</span>) divided by the probability of the extinction symbol that symbolize no systematic absences (E<span class="subscript">---</span>):</p>

      <span class="figurecaption"><b>Equation 1</b>: The log probabilities returned by ExtSym in table.asc.
  </span>
</div>
<p> For example, for the monoclinic crystal system with unique axis <em>b</em> we have E<span class="subscript">---</span> = 'P 1 - 1' (see the International Tables for Crystallography [1]). An example ExtSym output  for a monoclinic crystal system with unique axis <em>b</em> is shown below:</p>

      <span class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 1</b>: Shows the content of a table.asc file returned by ExtSym.
      </span></p>
</div>
<p>The 1st column lists the monoclinic extinction symbols as defined in the International Tables for Crystallography [1] and the 2nd column shows the log probability of each symbol as defined in Eq. 1. A positive log probability means the corresponding extinction symbol is more probable than P  <span class="subscript">- - -</span> and vice versa for negative log probabilities. Notice that for the output in Fig. 1 it just happens that only one extinction symbol is more probable than P 1 - 1.</p>
<p>Note that prior to July 2007 the output returned by ExtSym used the slightly more verbose form: </p>

<p>Examples of  ExtSym outputs (including the one above) can be downloaded by clicking any entry in the &quot;Best ExS&quot; column in any of the tables displayed on the <a href="results.html">ExtSym result page</a>. </p>

<h3>Warnings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The absolute values of the log probabilities returned in <span class="filename_style">table.asc</span> may depend considerably on the process by which .hkl files are generated from raw data files. Different Pawley or le Bail programs may provide outputs that, when converted into the .hkl format, result in considerably different absolute values of the log probabilities, while in general still keeping the same relative ranking order of the extinction symbols. Therefore when inspecting a <span class="filename_style">table.asc</span> file don't try to focus too hard on the individual log probability magnitudes but instead on their relative values. </li>
  <li>Although Extsym is shown on the <a href="results.html">result page</a> to have an impressive success in matching the most probable symbol to the published symbol,<em> this may not apply to your data</em>. Hence, please consider the ExtSym output as a guide to <em>help</em> you determine the correct extinction symbol for your crystalline material; the correct symbol may not be the top ranked symbol but perhaps the 3rd or 4th.</li>
