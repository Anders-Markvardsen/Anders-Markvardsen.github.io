<h2>Introduction and discussion </h2>
<p>Cuprate high-temperature superconductors were first synthesized 1986. A common feature  of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors is the presense of CuO<span class="subscript">2</span> sheets in the crystal structure as illustrated in Fig. 1 for the <span class="figurecaption">LnBa<span class="subscript">2</span>Cu<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="subscript">7</span></span> family of compounds.</p>

<p>Another cuprate  family is Ln<span class="subscript">2-x</span>Ba<span class="subscript">2+x</span>Cu<span class="subscript">2+y</span>Ti<span class="subscript">2-y</span>O<span class="subscript">11 </span>(abbreviated LnBCTO), where Ln is a rare earth element. However, so far no high-temperature compound of this family has been synthesized. The first member of this family to be prepared was GdBCTO [3] and the LnBCTO crystal structure takes the form: </p>

    <span class="figurecaption"><b>Figure 2</b>:

	Ln<span class="subscript">2-x</span>Ba<span class="subscript">2+x</span>Cu<span class="subscript">2+y</span>Ti<span class="subscript">2-y</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span>,

	</span>
</div>
<p>This family of compounds is seen to contain CuO<span class="subscript">2</span> sheets - the familiar constituent of cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Superconductivity is in many cases induced in cuprates by aliovalent doping, howing  doping this family of compounds has been shown to be difficult and often resulting in multi phase samples [4]. </p>
<p>In the work [1-2]  we presented the first successful substitution of trivalent Ln with divalent ion. Neodynium in Nd<span class="subscript">2-x</span>Ba<span class="subscript">2+x</span>Cu<span class="subscript">2</span>Ti<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span> was substituted with barium for vaues of x up to 0.8, and terbium in Tb<span class="subscript">2-x</span>Ba<span class="subscript">2+x</span>Cu<span class="subscript">2</span>Ti<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">11 </span>was substituted with barium for the value x=0.2. In addition a cupper rich Tb<span class="subscript">2-x</span>Ba<span class="subscript">2+x</span>Cu<span class="subscript">2+y</span>Ti<span class="subscript">2-y</span>O<span class="subscript">11 </span>compound with x=0.2 and y=0.1 was synthesized. The synthesis was carried out by mixing carefully the right amounts of reactants, pressing this mixture into pellets and  heating these in a furnace at high temperature. These 'doped' compounded were found from SQUID measurements not to superconduct at high temperatures. </p>
<p>A closer analysis of the crystal structure of these compounds reveals a number of potential reasons for the lack of superconductivity. One of these reasons is  Ti/Cu disorder, i.e. the Cu sites in the crystal  are partially occupied by Ti ions and vice versa. Ti 'impurities' in the CuO<span class="subscript">2</span> sheets could explain the lack of superconductivity in these materials. However compounds with excess cupper, as reported in [2] and [5], have been found from neutron powder diffraction studies to contain fully occupied  CuO<span class="subscript">2</span> sheets, still no high-temperature superconductivity was detected. Despite this result it is concluded from [2] that eventual superconducting LnBCTO compounds should contain excess Cu. </p>
<h2>Errata to  Ref. [2]</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Typing error second line of abstract. Replace Nd/Ba with Tb/Ba. </li>
  <li>The reference to [6] before the beginning of the second paragraph in the second column on page 28 should be moved up about 3 lines to site before the comma and behind the text &quot;shortened by Ba-doping&quot;. </li>
</ul>
